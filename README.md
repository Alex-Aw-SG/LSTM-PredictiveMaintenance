# LSTM-PredictiveMaintenance

Using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network for predictive maintenance is appealing because it is very good at learning from sequence. Although LSTM is popular for text analytic, this exercise shows LSTM's capability to be used in a different domain. This notebook uses keras library and Microsoft CNTK as backend.
